## Question set 1

Skills Needed to Answer the Questions

To solve the given questions, the following foundational JavaScript skills are required:

## 1. **Arrow Function Syntax**

- Understanding how to define and use arrow functions.
- Knowing the difference between concise syntax (single expression) and block body syntax (with `{}` and `return`).

## 2. **Basic Arithmetic and Operators**

- Using operators like:
  - `+` for addition.
  - `**` for exponentiation.
  - `%` for modulus (remainder).
- Performing basic mathematical and logical operations.

## 3. **String Manipulation**

- Accessing string properties (e.g., `.length`).
- Using string methods such as:
  - `.toUpperCase()` for case conversion.
  - `.split()` and `.join()` for breaking and reconstructing strings.
- Indexing strings with bracket notation (e.g., `str[0]` to get the first character).

## 4. **Logical Comparisons**

- Using comparison operators (`===`, `>`, `<`, etc.) to evaluate conditions.
- Writing expressions that return `true` or `false`.

## 5. **Array Methods**

- Using methods like:
  - `map()` for transforming arrays.
- Chaining multiple array methods for complex tasks (e.g., reversing a string).

## 6. **Control Structures**

- Implementing simple logic using conditional expressions.
- Combining methods and comparisons (e.g., `str === reversed`) to solve problems.

## 7. **Problem-Solving and Decomposition**

- Breaking down tasks into smaller steps.
- Applying logical reasoning to construct reusable functions (e.g., checking for palindromes).

## 8. **Basic ES6 Features**

- Leveraging modern ES6 syntax for:
  - Writing arrow functions.
  - Using concise syntax to write cleaner code.

These skills ensure a solid foundation for writing functional, reusable, and efficient JavaScript code.

1. Write an arrow function `add` that takes two parameters and returns their sum.

2. Create an arrow function `isEven` that checks if a number is even.

3. Write an arrow function `getFirstChar` that takes a string and returns its first character.

4. Define an arrow function `square` that returns the square of a number.

5. Create an arrow function `concatStrings` that concatenates two strings.

6. Write an arrow function `isPositive` that checks if a number is positive.

7. Define an arrow function `doubleArray` that takes an array and returns a new array with all values doubled.

8. Write an arrow function `getLength` that returns the length of a string.

9. Create an arrow function `isPalindrome` that checks if a string is a palindrome.

10. Define an arrow function `toUpperCase` that converts a string to uppercase.
